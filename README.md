# taquin-3d

The classical game called _Taquin_ in french is a board on which lie 15 little squares arranged in 4 rows and 4 cols. The remaining space allows contiguous squares to slide. In english, this game if often call [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

Hence, __taquin-3d__ is the 3D version of this game. Tapping a tiny cube will move it if it is adjacent to an empty space.
